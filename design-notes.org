* KNOWERS AND "WORLD"
The database of facts maps from "knowers" to lists of known things. The knower
'world is special; it knows the true facts. This creates complications, because
knows(world, knows(Person, X)) and knows(Person,X) are "morally equivalent" but
technically distinct.

* UNLEARNING FACTS
We never forget a fact once learned. However, queries find only the _first_ fact matching a
given pattern. So:

1. Most facts come with a "mode", which can be positive or negative.[1]

2. To make a fact false, we push the same fact with its mode flipped on the
   FRONT of the list; so a query finds the false fact first.

[1] There are other modes, too. They seem to have to do with the English text
generation component.
