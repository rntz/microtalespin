;; records, consisting of:
;;
;; 1. A "header" atom (the tag).
;; 2. A finite map from roles (atoms) to their fillers (various things).
;;
;; Sack uses pure s-expressions for CDs. I make a struct, and map roles to their
;; fillers with hashtables rather than association lists. This simplifies my
;; code, but sacrifices the "simplicity" of just using s-expressions for
;; everything.

;; ===== UNIFICATION =====

;; Unification can be seen as finding the least upper bound in a lattice of
;; partial information. For example, (?X, "world") and ("hello", ?Y) are each
;; "partially defined pairs". (?X, "world") tells us the second part of the pair
;; is "world", but does nothing but give a name, ?X, to the first part of the
;; pair. The unification of (?X, "world") and ("hello", ?Y) is that ?X = "hello"
;; and ?Y = "world", giving ("hello", "world").
;;
;; The lattice used for CD unification is interesting, in two ways:
;;
;; 1. The role-filler pairs of a CD have no ordering on them; it's just an
;; associative map.
;;
;; 2. Normally, the only way a term can "grow" in the lattice ordering is by
;; unifying a variable inside it with a term. However, CDs also "grow" if they
;; gain a role-filler pair. For example,
;;
;;     (cd 'foo (hash)) <= (cd 'foo (hash 'x 42))
;;
;; Sacks describes this as follows:
;;
;; > (2) a missing pair in one CD means that that CD is more general than the
;; > other CD and can, thus, be matched against it
;;
;; I'm still not fully sure how this _ought_ to interact with unification
;; variables, but I've tried to imitate Sack's code's behavior.

;; Sack's code uses association lists for substitutions. I use Racket hash
;; tables; they provide the interface I need and are probably more efficient.
;; Sack's code has a global flag that disables/enables the occurs check. I
;; always perform the check.
